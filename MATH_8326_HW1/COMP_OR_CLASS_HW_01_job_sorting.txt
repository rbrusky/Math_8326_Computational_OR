Solver Description:

The jobs will be sorted in order of Processing Time in ascending order.

Using the sorted list of jobs calculate the completed date for each job.

Determine the greatest Due Date.

The jobs will be split into two groups.  The jobs that have a completed date on or before
the greatest Due Date will be in the first group.  The remaining jobs will be in the second 
group.

The concept is to complete as many jobs on-time as possible.  So the first group will be
sorted by due date.

The need for the second group is to complete the jobs as fast as possible, because at this
point all the jobs in the second group are considered to be late.  So the second group
will remain sorted by ascending Processing Time.

The two groups will be concatenated together and the total days of tardiness will be
calculated.
